===========

metadata driving angular to make custom forms

Dynamic Templates is useful when you have data that drives the view.
If you start with some data...
```[{"name": "simple demo", "url": "demo1.html"},
  {"name": "More involved demo", "url": "demo2.html"}```

and a (view) template list...
```["basic_demo.html", "more_involved_demo.html"]```
