Metadata driving angular to make custom forms

Dynamic Templates is useful when you have data that drives the view.

If you start with some data...
```
[
  {"name": "simple example", "content": "Basic content that could be rendered in several ways..."},
  {"name": "More involved demo", "url": "demo2.html"}
]
```

and add in some view related data...
```
[{"template": "basic.html"}, {"template": "more_involved.html"}]
```
