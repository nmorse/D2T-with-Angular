formangular
===========

Data driving angular to make custom views (<a href="http://nmorse.github.io/D2T-with-Angular/" target="_new">demo</a>)

Dynamic Templates is useful when you have data that drives the view.
If you start with some data...
```[{"name": "simple demo", "url": "demo1.html"},
  {"name": "More involved demo", "url": "demo2.html"}```

and a (view) template list...
```["basic_demo.html", "more_involved_demo.html"]```
